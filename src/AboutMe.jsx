            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>As showcased earlier, I thoroughly enjoy working with backend systems, 
                but that’s not all there is to me. If I’m not in front of my laptop 
                working on, revisiting, or improving a project, I’m at the gym, doing 
                arts and crafts, or watching anime/reading manhwa! I have many hobbies 
                I look forward to incorporating into my life, such as roller skating and 
                ice skating, archery, learning to play the cello, learning jiu-jitsu, and
                sewing my own clothes.</p>
            <p>In tech spaces, I know that technical knowledge isn’t everything, soft skills
                 matter too. I take pride in my ability to work well in a team setting, 
                 communicate issues, ideas, and concerns in a timely manner, and be adaptable 
                 and flexible, since there are always multiple ways to solve a problem. I also 
                 value my persistence, self-motivation, and problem-solving, even when tasks 
                 are difficult.</p>
