            <p>Hello! I’m a Massachusetts-based backend engineer by trade,
             with hands-on experience across the full stack through personal 
             projects. My primary interest lies in backend development, where 
             I enjoy designing and making APIs, working with relational databases, 
             and strengthening application security using Java, Spring Boot, and 
             SQL as my core tech stack.</p>
